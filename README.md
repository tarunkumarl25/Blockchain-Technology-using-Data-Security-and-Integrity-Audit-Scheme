1. Problem Statement: Increasing usage of cloud storage raises concerns about data integrity. Traditional blockchain-based data integrity audit schemes face issues like high maintenance costs and rapid block growth.

2. Proposed Solution:

A data integrity system using blockchain expansion technology.

Smart contracts are deployed on both the main chain and sub-chains.

Intensive computing tasks are handled by sub-chains, and their results are periodically submitted to the main chain to ensure finality.

3. Non-Interactive Audit:

Introduces non-interactive audit to avoid affecting user experience by reducing communication with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) during the audit process.

4. Reward Pool Mechanism:

Implements a reward pool mechanism to enhance data security.

5. Analysis and Validation:

Comprehensive analysis covers storage, batch auditing, and data consistency.

Experiments on the Ethereum blockchain demonstrate reduced storage and computational overhead.
